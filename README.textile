h2. Introduction

*Athena* is a suite of encrypted communication software. *Athena* is made of two parts:

* Athena client software
* Aegis server software

We are in VERY early development at the moment. At its completion, *Athena* will use RSA strong encryption for simple, confidential communication.

h2. Summary

*Athena* makes use of asymmetric RSA encryption between trusted contacts. *Aegis* acts as an abstracting intermediary, but does not know anything about the connected clients aside from their IP address. 

h2. Overview

The routing headers are encrypted so only *Aegis* knows the sender and recipient of the message, and the message is encrypted so that only the recipient knows what it says. Each message also contains a digital signature to verify the sender.
