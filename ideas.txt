lamenteintrepida: i dont see why not? well have to try it
greg_leb: Ok we can text it
gwyrox732: i mean, 64bit linu works fine
lamenteintrepida: on diff OS setups
gwyrox732: and it all runs in the jvm
greg_leb: Yep
greg_leb: Alright
greg_leb: Sweet
greg_leb: I can change tht
lamenteintrepida: and the app runs on vista and 7 right?
greg_leb: We can do some tests with a bunch of vms 
greg_leb: Yes
lamenteintrepida: provided you have java installed, it should work anywhere
greg_leb: Right
greg_leb: Norm
greg_leb: Steve mentioned earlier - should we create an installer
lamenteintrepida: on a plane, on a train, in a boat, in a moat
lamenteintrepida: etc
greg_leb: that recognizes that you dont have java
greg_leb: and installs it?
gwyrox732: sounds good to me. it's all about simplicity.
greg_leb: Right
greg_leb: Exactly.
lamenteintrepida: i think the should download an installer
gwyrox732: package a deb and/or rpm?
greg_leb: I want it be orgasmic-ly simple
lamenteintrepida: and it updates you to latest java
greg_leb: Yeah definitely.
lamenteintrepida: and installs 
lamenteintrepida: and says :-) at the end
greg_leb: Haha
gwyrox732: haha
greg_leb: So file transfer is a must
greg_leb: Norm
lamenteintrepida: def agree w that
greg_leb: Steve and I were also talking about some imap/pop support? 
gwyrox732: yeah
lamenteintrepida: esp for ppms and xls and doc and lots of business docs like that
gwyrox732: did you see what i added to the wiki?
greg_leb: Maybe a little message appears in your focused window that says you have a new email?
greg_leb: Nope - lemme check
gwyrox732: it was like a week ago
gwyrox732: i added like 3 items
greg_leb: In what?
greg_leb: Arch?
gwyrox732: yeah
greg_leb: K 
gwyrox732: i think they're a little scattered
lamenteintrepida: link me it
lamenteintrepida: so i can bookmark it
greg_leb: http://emura.wikispaces.com
gwyrox732: 
PHP sign-up. Username? Or assigned ID? Or just use key as UID? Info encrypted with server's public key before transmit.

Challenge/Response before chat is allowed?

"Anonymous" SMTP relay available to users (authenticated users can send encrypted email from one-time use email using user's private key).
greg_leb: PHP sign up: for the website?
gwyrox732: like to get your username and keys on the server
gwyrox732: there needs to be a signup
greg_leb: Right
greg_leb: But on the website?
gwyrox732: i guess it could be through the program, though
greg_leb: Oh
greg_leb: Ok
greg_leb: Oh
greg_leb: Also
greg_leb: An idea:
greg_leb: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WxWidgets
greg_leb: Maybe it'll be a little prettier?
greg_leb: Than swing?
greg_leb: It's cross platform
gwyrox732: as long as it's cross-platform, i'm okay with giving it a shot.
greg_leb: http://wx4j.sourceforge.net/
greg_leb: Im just pasting links in here cuz im going to copy and paste this chat
gwyrox732: k
greg_leb: But wx4j is the java binding for wxWidgets
gwyrox732: figured as much
lamenteintrepida: so what would we have to do code wise
gwyrox732: wx definitely looks more native than swing
greg_leb: It shouldn't be too bad
greg_leb: Is that good or bad?
gwyrox732: good
gwyrox732: better visual integration witht he rest of the user's computer experience
gwyrox732: i might say, if i were a manager
greg_leb: I would like to have maby some transparency? Some sexy curves
greg_leb: So this was designed in wxwidgets  http://img.brothersoft.com/screenshots/softimage/w/wxwidgets-115143-1.jpeg
gwyrox732: transparency can sometimes cross the line into being cumbersome if it isn't done right
greg_leb: Haha
greg_leb: Understood.
lamenteintrepida: curves are nice
gwyrox732: vibestation. sounds exciting
greg_leb: ahah
greg_leb: What about plugins ?
lamenteintrepida: would we need any?
greg_leb: We dont neeed any
gwyrox732: you seem to've stopped thinking simple
greg_leb: But people may want to code them
greg_leb: True I guess
lamenteintrepida: its business so
lamenteintrepida: well try to keep it focused on its main purposes
lamenteintrepida: and not bog it down with things people wish were in every app alive
lamenteintrepida: cuz they are becoming that way
greg_leb: True - 
greg_leb: So
greg_leb: If this open source
greg_leb: I'm worried about people removing the encryption or changing that
greg_leb: Or is that something we shouldn't worry about
gwyrox732: that's something we shouldn't worry about. if they remove or change the encryption, the person on the other end won't be able to do shit
lamenteintrepida: are we leavin git open source?
greg_leb: Haha
greg_leb: Valid
gwyrox732: hell, a connection will never be made
greg_leb: I mean
greg_leb: Do you want to leave it open source?
gwyrox732: i want to, first of all
greg_leb: Ok then yes
lamenteintrepida: whats your reasoning for it
gwyrox732: second of all, we use gnucrypto right now so we have to
lamenteintrepida: im cool either way
greg_leb: Yeah we're using a gnu crypto library
greg_leb: So we have too 
greg_leb: for encrypting the data
lamenteintrepida: k
lamenteintrepida: do you wanna do buddy list
greg_leb: Of course
gwyrox732: yeah
lamenteintrepida: where someone has to make an actual ID
lamenteintrepida: that they keep
lamenteintrepida: rather than randomly generated
greg_leb: Yeah well they'll create a username
greg_leb: Screen name, persay
lamenteintrepida: that will be saved right
lamenteintrepida: not one time use
gwyrox732: we can do that, or people can be identified by their public keys
greg_leb: Automatically on their computer?
gwyrox732: i'm not sure
greg_leb: Alright
greg_leb: Good thing we're continuing this to our senior project
gwyrox732: yeah
greg_leb: Oh
greg_leb: And we need to decide on a better port
greg_leb: 7777 aint gunna hack it
gwyrox732: why's that?
greg_leb: Noone keeps that open
gwyrox732: it doesn't need to be
gwyrox732: that's the point of a central server to mediate connections
greg_leb: Ok
greg_leb: So our server will just do that for us?
greg_leb: K
greg_leb: So 
greg_leb: We're not doing p2p connections then
greg_leb: So each message will flow through the auth server
gwyrox732: well when the connection is made it will be through the server
greg_leb: K
lamenteintrepida: might be more reliable that way
gwyrox732: we can see if we can transition to p2p
greg_leb: Yeah definitely.
gwyrox732: after the session is trusted
greg_leb: But you're right
greg_leb: Yeah 
greg_leb: Good idea
lamenteintrepida: chat rooms?
lamenteintrepida: or just one on one messaging
greg_leb: We could have group caht
greg_leb: chat*
gwyrox732: yeah
lamenteintrepida: that could be lower down the list
lamenteintrepida: of priorities
gwyrox732: yeah, that can be off in senior project land
lamenteintrepida: somethin like that
lamenteintrepida: we goign to archive/log convos?
gwyrox732: no
lamenteintrepida: didnt think so
gwyrox732: i mean, the users can do it themselves
gwyrox732: but the server won't
lamenteintrepida: alright
greg_leb: Yeah I mean itll be more difficult on the server end - cuz we'd have to decrypt the data on the fly
lamenteintrepida: how does your code generate a key btw
lamenteintrepida: randomize?
lamenteintrepida: based on the rSA thing that i dont know
gwyrox732: right now, it does a diffie hellman with a random pime number
gwyrox732: and we end up with a two-way rsa key
greg_leb: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange.
lamenteintrepida: sounds like an oceans eleven stunt
greg_leb: hahaha
gwyrox732: we'll have to switch to public key
gwyrox732: hahaha
lamenteintrepida: so if someone creates a permanent user id
lamenteintrepida: will they have a diff key every time they connect
gwyrox732: no
greg_leb: In this case
gwyrox732: in this implementation:
greg_leb: yhes
greg_leb: But in the real final product, no
lamenteintrepida: ah okay
gwyrox732: users will create a public and private key when they sign up
gwyrox732: which will stay the same
lamenteintrepida: ohh alright
gwyrox732: and be stored (private key hashed?) on the server
lamenteintrepida: and they just login with that
lamenteintrepida: well, theyre user id and what not
gwyrox732: yeah
lamenteintrepida: but they will have a dedicated key
lamenteintrepida: got it
lamenteintrepida: option to reset key/change user id/ anything random like that
gwyrox732: we can do that
greg_leb: Yeah we can do that
greg_leb: That can be on the website
lamenteintrepida: idk why someone would wanna reset key but
lamenteintrepida: alright that works
greg_leb: I do
greg_leb: if it has been compromised
greg_leb: have to reset the key
gwyrox732: right
lamenteintrepida: so itd be like a change password kinda thing
greg_leb: Yes
lamenteintrepida: that works
greg_leb: And we need to make sure our authentication server has some pretty good security on it
gwyrox732: yeah
gwyrox732: i mean
gwyrox732: all the private keys can be like sha512 hashed in our db
gwyrox732: so it's nota huge deal
greg_leb: Yea
gwyrox732: but yeah, security is obviously key
lamenteintrepida: whats the server going to be
greg_leb: idk yet
greg_leb: we can do it on mediatemple
greg_leb: idk
lamenteintrepida: doesnt need any standalone s/w right? just a network host
lamenteintrepida: some domain
lamenteintrepida: of some sort
lamenteintrepida: er
greg_leb: Yeah - and mysql
lamenteintrepida: standalone h/w
lamenteintrepida: so the server will be a domain thats basically running 24/7
gwyrox732: yeah
greg_leb: Yeah
lamenteintrepida: mysql for data storage?
greg_leb: The keys and user information, yes
lamenteintrepida: okay
greg_leb: Wait, norm
gwyrox732: it doesn't need to be too beefy, it just handles auth and make connections between users
lamenteintrepida: yeap
greg_leb: wouldn;'t the server need our application on it
gwyrox732: yeah
greg_leb: so it couldn't be on mediatemple
gwyrox732: right
greg_leb: I vote your app for now
greg_leb: Since you're on buisness class internet
gwyrox732: that's fine
greg_leb: Then after we graduate we can move it wherever
greg_leb: my command center, idc
gwyrox732: and just rake in the cash
lamenteintrepida: loll
lamenteintrepida: suddenly start charging users
greg_leb: You think we could make money off of this?
gwyrox732: probably not
greg_leb: Advertise places haha
lamenteintrepida: i dont know many chat clients that you have to pay for
gwyrox732: we'll probably just make death threats from the cinese government if anything
greg_leb: haha
greg_leb: LOL
greg_leb: that's fine
lamenteintrepida: tell korea theyre next if they dont buy our product
greg_leb: Im used to it, really.
greg_leb: haha
gwyrox732: is this email the latest version of the proposal? i want to make some changes.
greg_leb: Make changes and use track changes
greg_leb: just so i know what changed
gwyrox732: k
lamenteintrepida: so will that widgets thing basically run the java code but make it look more likke windows?
lamenteintrepida: thats the impression im getting
gwyrox732: exactly
gwyrox732: it uses wxwidgets that just look more native to each operating system than swing does
lamenteintrepida: what would we have to put into our code
lamenteintrepida: like widget.button?
lamenteintrepida: isntead of swing.button?
greg_leb: Hold on
greg_leb: Probably.
lamenteintrepida: widget.loadnicecurves
greg_leb: hahah
greg_leb: hold on
greg_leb: http://wx4j.sourceforge.net/documentation/api/
greg_leb: I love java api
greg_leb: YOu're right steve.
greg_leb: wxButton
greg_leb: wxButton.wxAlign_Top
greg_leb: Simple shit
greg_leb: wxButton.wxItalic_Font
lamenteintrepida: looks pretty simple
gwyrox732: seems like it should be pretty simple to just drop it in and do a couple of tweaks
lamenteintrepida: maybe intellisense knows about wx
greg_leb: Yeah definitely. 
lamenteintrepida: prolly not
greg_leb: Hahahaha
greg_leb: Have fun coding that in Visual Studio
lamenteintrepida: ahaha
lamenteintrepida: eclipse-sense?
lamenteintrepida: :-(
greg_leb: We going to use eclipse?
lamenteintrepida: eclipse or netbeans id say
lamenteintrepida: ive used both, i dont really have a pref
greg_leb: I think Norm and I coded this all in notepad
gwyrox732: yup
gwyrox732: just waht i was going to say
gwyrox732: well, i jused gedit which has syntax highlighting
greg_leb: Yeah - I used notepad++ 
gwyrox732: but if we're using an IDE, I nominate eclipse
greg_leb: K
greg_leb: eclipse it is
gwyrox732: which i hate slightly less than netbeans
greg_leb: What about version control?
greg_leb: I dont like git
greg_leb: :(
greg_leb: haha
greg_leb: But
greg_leb: Perhaps we should use it
lamenteintrepida: liek builds and releases?
greg_leb: Concurrent version control
greg_leb: So we all have the same version
greg_leb: on each other's machines
gwyrox732: well we use subversion right now, shall we upgrade to git? github?
greg_leb: Yeah
greg_leb: We can do that when we start to code
greg_leb: Should we keep the name
greg_leb: EMURA?
greg_leb: OR something new
gwyrox732: well, i've grown attached to the name, but it's not really very accurate anymore
greg_leb: Well 
lamenteintrepida: hmm
greg_leb: It could be 
gwyrox732: since we switched from rijndael to aes
greg_leb: Ah
greg_leb: Yes
greg_leb: Valid
greg_leb: Emuae
greg_leb: lmao
lamenteintrepida: lol
gwyrox732: haha
greg_leb: inpronounable
lamenteintrepida: pronouncable
greg_leb: LOL
lamenteintrepida: 48 vowels
greg_leb: haha
gwyrox732: it's pronounced em-way
greg_leb: haha
greg_leb: I can sleep on that one
lamenteintrepida: sounds cool but it would give ppl headaches
greg_leb: Give it some though
greg_leb: hhah
gwyrox732: yeah
greg_leb: Lots of things to think about
gwyrox732: yup
lamenteintrepida: should be a sexy name
greg_leb: Definitely.
lamenteintrepida: Athena
greg_leb: haha
lamenteintrepida: chat client of wisdom and love
greg_leb: LOL
greg_leb: perfect
gwyrox732: haha i like it
greg_leb: I like Athena
greg_leb: We can stick with greek/roman names
greg_leb: Jupiter
greg_leb: Orion
lamenteintrepida: lmao
greg_leb: haha
lamenteintrepida: orion?
lamenteintrepida: hmm
lamenteintrepida: Bug Man?
greg_leb: haha what
lamenteintrepida: MIB
greg_leb: Bug man 
greg_leb: really
greg_leb: dude
greg_leb: the galaxy is on orions belt
lamenteintrepida: OBV
gwyrox732: haha
lamenteintrepida: *meow*
greg_leb: haha
greg_leb: I need some sugar water
greg_leb: I vote for Athena until / if we find a better name
lamenteintrepida: lmfaoo
gwyrox732: agreed
lamenteintrepida: Athena has a nice ring to it
greg_leb: Yeah it does
lamenteintrepida: "dude go on Athena"
greg_leb: hahaha
gwyrox732: hahaha
lamenteintrepida: "OMG DEF IM THERE'
greg_leb: lmao sounds perfect
greg_leb: Ok
greg_leb: So
greg_leb: The proposal is pretty much done
greg_leb: Norm - just edit those things
greg_leb: Steve you look at it after that
greg_leb: To see if there are any changes you want to make to it
lamenteintrepida: do we have any new features we want to add to the prop
greg_leb: and then ill finish it off
greg_leb: Uhh
greg_leb: Maybe just the SMTP stufff
gwyrox732: yeah, i like the thought of being able to do one-off encrypted emails from a temporary address through us
greg_leb: That's a sick idea
lamenteintrepida: where would the address be located
lamenteintrepida: on the site?
greg_leb: But how would the recipient read them
lamenteintrepida: like generated on the server
lamenteintrepida: yeah thats what i mean
gwyrox732: yeah, it would be like random@athena.org
gwyrox732: and it just becomes a regular pgp-signed email
lamenteintrepida: email would only be functional when they were logged in?
gwyrox732: yeah
greg_leb: Yeah it can be a new tab or something
gwyrox732: and it just generates a new string every time they send one so it can't be traced
greg_leb: Sounds good
lamenteintrepida: so they check it on the app then?
lamenteintrepida: maybe it could just open in its own window
lamenteintrepida: within the app
gwyrox732: well, should they be able to recv email in the program?
lamenteintrepida: then they can choose to save email maybe
gwyrox732: i guess it makes sense, but then each user needs a permanent email
lamenteintrepida: well if its a one time thing, i guess, where else would you suggest
lamenteintrepida: well that can be username@athena.org?
gwyrox732: yeah, we can do that
gwyrox732: and they can send/recv using that email, but they can also send using [randomstring]@athena.org
greg_leb: Good idea
gwyrox732: also, athena.org is already owned :(
greg_leb: noooooooooooo
greg_leb: getathena.or
greg_leb: g
gwyrox732: haha
gwyrox732: no dice
lamenteintrepida: athenachat.org?
gwyrox732: looks clear to me
greg_leb: woo
gwyrox732: org, com, net, tel, me, us, and biz are all available
lamenteintrepida: hmm
lamenteintrepida: what do you think
lamenteintrepida: org or net id say
greg_leb: org>
gwyrox732: i like org
lamenteintrepida: done
lamenteintrepida: youre goin to hollywood
lamenteintrepida: 3 votes
gwyrox732: haha
greg_leb: hahah
greg_leb: american idol for chat clients
lamenteintrepida: Please audition to login:
gwyrox732: 'please sing the first verse to secret agent man to authenticate this session'
greg_leb: hahaha
greg_leb: Alright well I feel like we got a lot of work done 
lamenteintrepida: i think so too we have a real solid plan
lamenteintrepida: some ppl dont even have groups
lamenteintrepida: ...
greg_leb: LOL
greg_leb: I know
gwyrox732: haha yup
greg_leb: not to mention ideas
greg_leb: Or
lamenteintrepida: proposal
lamenteintrepida: or
greg_leb: Some people have ideas
lamenteintrepida: project 2007 installed
greg_leb: "I want to code an embedded software that recognizes the color schema of pictures that are viewed"
greg_leb: WHAT
gwyrox732: i have no use for gantt charts anyway
greg_leb: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
gwyrox732: hahaha who said taht?
greg_leb: idk some kid in our class
gwyrox732: haha
lamenteintrepida: prolly shawn gratton
lamenteintrepida: "one of my ideas was um to analyze the micro bit pixels of hyperkinetic space time in an androgeometric containment environment using a semi-calibrated hydrocarbon particle accelerator"
lamenteintrepida: just an idea though...
greg_leb: LMAO
greg_leb: let's do it
gwyrox732: hahahaha
lamenteintrepida: write the prop
lamenteintrepida: it would be
lamenteintrepida: 0_o
lamenteintrepida: thats it
greg_leb: lol
greg_leb: Alright
greg_leb: i'm tired
greg_leb: Time for a shake and bed
gwyrox732: k. i'll edit this proposal up and send it back to everyone.
lamenteintrepida: time to read for humanities
greg_leb: Ok sweet
lamenteintrepida: i love comp sci
greg_leb: haha have fun
lamenteintrepida: sounds good
greg_leb: This convo is saved
greg_leb: See y
lamenteintrepida: 10-4.
