		!! Created ClientApplet.makeTab(String) which will make a tab and associated MapTextArea object.
		!! If a tab for a user doesn't exist, create a tab first. Everything else runs as before.
		!! Ref - Client:142    ClientApplet:153
	## Make the main text window inside the tab UNEDITABLE (assume it's just .setEditable(false)
