General Guidelines:
 - Pay attention to new code, but not exclusively. As our codebase gets larger, it's easy to just read
   over what we've done this week. Again, pay special attention to new code, but do not ignore old code.

 - Make sure code is commented clearly. Professionalism is not a big concern, but I do need to know what
   a line or method does, especially as our code gets more complex. Be sure to add references to other
   pieces of the program it makes use of so I don't have to go searching. Line numbers never hurt anyone.

 - Make sure code is clean and readable. Sometimes I try to jam into 1 line, what would better be served
   in 5 lines. Try not to do this. If the benefit (speed/memory) is big enough to warrant it (IYO) just
   be sure it is commented to hell and back so everyone can read it. Check indentation so we can easily
   match up code blocks. We have to work on our variable and method names, too. They have to be unique,
   informative, and not generic (we have too many blahUserblahSocketPanelblahblah).

 - If you find anything that needs to be done, add a TODO inline in the code. Do NOT make any significant
   changes to the code during the code review. Wait until after the review. If you need to break down or
   clarify some confusing code, that's okay, but don't add any new code.
