Senior Project Ideas:

Last Edited 04/08/2010:
 ## Client blacklist or whitelist
	@@ Clients can decide who can talk to them and see their status
	
 ## File Transfer
	@@ Clients can offer files to other users (in a chat).
	@@ Other clients are notified and accept/decline it.
	@@ File is chunked and encrypted, sent across and reassembled
	@@ File is sent with encrypted md5
		?? Do we use AES with a session key so it's faster?
		?? User's identities should be established manually
		   if they want to accept files.
 ## Group Chat
	@@ Everyone establishes everyone elses identity
		?? What's the most efficient way?
	@@ A session key is generated between two of the people
		?? Users randomly chosen?
		?? Diffie-Hellman?
	@@ Key is then encrypted and sent to the other users
	
 ## Inline images
	@@ Images should be displayed right in the chat tab
	@@ Tranferred similarly to file transfer
		?? Do we make them switch to AES?
		
 ## Idle time reporting
	@@ Buddy names that are "idle" on the service for the certain amount of time
	   are dimmed on the user's list
		?? How is this calculated and reported?
		?? System idle time we can get somewhere?
	@@ Once idle time reaches a certain amount, we send another status flag (3)

 ## Away message auto-responder
	@@ There will be a new online status flag (proposed: 2)
	@@ When away client receives a message, it auto-responds with an away message (if there is one)
	
 ## Should we build a p2p key exchange system
