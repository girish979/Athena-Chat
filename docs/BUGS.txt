CLIENT:
	## Program will not spawn new tab for incoming message that would open the tab.
		!! RESOLVED: Wrote a makeTab(String) to run when there isn't a tab for a user.
		!! Created ClientApplet.makeTab(String) which will make a tab and associated MapTextArea object.
		!! If a tab for a user doesn't exist, create a tab first. Everything else runs as before.
		!! Ref - Client:142    ClientApplet:153
	## Make the main text window inside the tab UNEDITABLE (assume it's just .setEditable(false)
		!! RESOLVED: myTF.setEditable(false);

	## When not connected - do not allow user to be able to attempt to send messages
		@@ Right now it just shows up as `null`:`message`
		!! RESOLVED: Checked to see if username is null before attempted to send.

SERVER:
	## When a user disconnects, something does close cleanly causing a lot of exceptions to be printed
		!! RESOLVED: Thread runs respective to int isAlive. If routeMessage() can no longer run, isAlive is switched to 0 and the thread exits.
	## If 000 is sent to Aegis, but the newuser process is not followed, it crashes.
		@@ Should have it return to regular method if the process is not followed instead of excepting
		@@ Issue is related to it not being passed an int. Though I guess that won't be an issue once we implement a sane way of moving eventcodes back and forth.
