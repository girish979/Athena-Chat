	## When a user signs on and another user signs off at the same time, the user that signs on gets a strange message from the server outputted to his/her screen instead of into the program
		!! Seems to have something to do with Server.sendToAll()	
	## Program will not spawn new tab for incoming message that would open the tab.
		!! RESOLVED: Wrote a makeTab(String) to run when there isn't a tab for a user.
		!! Created ClientApplet.makeTab(String) which will make a tab and associated MapTextArea object.
		!! If a tab for a user doesn't exist, create a tab first. Everything else runs as before.
